# Let's Get Social! Working with NoSQL

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This work introduces us to NoSQL with MongoDB as our tool in visualizing data collections. MongoDB serves as our Object Document Mapper. We created the backend for a mock social media application.

There is no frontend portion for this so all API endpoint testing was was done in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

## Installation

- MongoDB is required for this app to run, so follow directions outlined [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) for a step-by-step guide depending on your operating system.

- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.

`npm i mongoose`

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is the ODM JavaScript library that connects MongoDB and NodeJS.

`npm i express`

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is needed for our server setup.

### Optional, but recommended:

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to enable automatic restarting of your server upon any detected changes.

## Usage

We start up the server with `nodemon index` and begin testing our endpoints in Insomnia Core. The following video tests all of the routes. The video can also be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-r2_mY8GvPFHTNZgMpnDiGvLdBl00js/view?usp=sharing).
